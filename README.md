cafe.fishing is an opt-in expansion to Minecraft's fishing system. This means that you have to intentionally seek out a way to start using this datapack.

Craft special cafe.fishing villager conversion items. Throw these items at a villager to convert them to a special trader. These unique traders allow you to purchase special cafe.fishing rods and sell your caught fish for fish coins.

In order to get the full experience, download and use the cafe.fishing resource pack alongside the datapack. It only affects fish caught from this datapack, nothing else is changed.
<br><br>
All art was hand-drawn by the lovely artists of Cafe Dot, with credits showing who drew each fish when caught. A big thank you to everyone who contributed below!
