# WebFishing Datapack

This is a proof-of-concept/work in progress Minecraft datapack called based on [WEBFISHING](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3146520/WEBFISHING/) by [lamedeveloper](https://lamedeveloper.itch.io/).

## Installation

1. Place the `webfishing` folder in `/datapacks` inside your Minecraft world folder.
2. Run `/reload` in-game to activate the datapack.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve this datapack! Here's how you can help:

Modify the `fish.json` file in the `data/webfishing/loot_tables/entities` folder to add new fish types.

For now, each fish is intended to be sourced from WEBFISHING, you can find the fish on the [WEBFISHING wiki](https://webfishing.wiki.gg/wiki/Fish).

- Each fish should have 6 quality variants and follow the naming, lore, and color scheme of the original.
  - Standard (0 stars)
  - Shining ⭐
  - Glistening ⭐⭐
  - Radiant ⭐⭐⭐
  - Opulent ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Alpha ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

See the "Salmon" fish as an example.
